## 🚀 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Giri Raj Koirala**, a Nepali developer based in **Virginia, USA**, with a passion that spans from writing code to reaching for the stars—literally. While my peers were playing games, I was **coding since childhood**, building applications and solving problems with technology. But here's the thing: software engineering is just one chapter of my journey. My ultimate dream? **Becoming an astronaut** 🚀.

### 🌟 My Journey

I co-founded **[Aethyra](https://github.com/KoiralaGiri)** with my friend **Pratik**, where we focus on creating innovative **software technologies** while also providing comprehensive **IT services** for businesses. From building enterprise-grade web applications to deploying secure desktop software, we're dedicated to delivering solutions that make a real impact.

### 🎓 Academic Aspirations

I'm currently pursuing my path to become an **aerospace engineer**, planning to earn my **Master's degree in Systems Engineering** (or a related field) with a **minor in Computer Science**. This blend of software expertise and aerospace knowledge is my launchpad—quite literally—to join the space industry and eventually work with NASA or a commercial space program.

### 🔧 Technical DNA

```matlab
% My skill set in MATLAB-style array
languages = ["TypeScript", "Python", "JavaScript", "C++", "MATLAB"];
passions = ["Aerospace Engineering", "Full-Stack Development", "Rocket Science", "Systems Design"];
current_projects = ["Better Mail", "AgentFusion", "Model Rockets", "University Prep"];
ultimate_goal = "Become an astronaut and explore space";
fun_fact = "I've built model rockets with RF telemetry systems from scratch!";
```

**From Earth to Space:**
- 🔐 **Security Obsessed**: Privacy-first email clients with end-to-end encryption
- 🏗️ **Full-Stack Builder**: Django backends, React frontends, Electron desktop apps
- 🚀 **Hardware Hacker**: Arduino-powered model rockets with real-time telemetry
- 🤖 **AI Integrator**: Leveraging OpenAI for automation and intelligent systems
- 🎨 **UI/UX Enthusiast**: Crafting beautiful interfaces with Tailwind, Material-UI, and animations
- 📊 **Data Visualizer**: Using Three.js and Recharts for immersive data experiences

**Beyond Code:**
When I'm not coding for Aethyra or studying for my aerospace career, you'll find me in my workshop designing the next iteration of my model rockets, simulating flight trajectories in OpenRocket, or diving deep into systems engineering textbooks. I've already built functional model rockets with telemetry systems, and I'm planning to create even more sophisticated designs during university. The sky isn't the limit—it's just the beginning.
