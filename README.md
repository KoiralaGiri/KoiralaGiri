### About Me

I've been coding since I was a kid, and have been building my experience since I was around 10. I'm confident in most high-level languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, MATLAB, and the React framework, but I'm also trying to self-learn IaC tools like HCL for Terraform and JSON for Kubernetes. I am, however, pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering with a hope of concentrating on propulsion and astronautics. Space has always been fascinating, so I try to spend some of my day learning the Arduino language as well. I built my own flight computer back in 2022 with basic programming for the accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer and also designed the rocket on OpenRocket, but haven't been able to build it yet.

Below is a list of the technologies I know well or am currently learning. It's a mix of my core strengths and active learning areas, since I spend most of my free time coding on projects.
